Usually, the best way to use the LicenseScout is to just configure it as a Maven Plug-in as described in the 
section link:usage.html["Usage"]  and it will be downloaded automatically when executing Maven.

However, if for some reason you prefer to download it manually, you can use the following possibilities:

* Maven central (releases): https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/aposin/licensescout/
* Sonatype server (snapshots, releases): https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~licensescout
