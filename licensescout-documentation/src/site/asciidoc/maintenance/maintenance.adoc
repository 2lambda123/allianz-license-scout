This handbook describes project maintenance tasks for the LicenseScout project.

== General conventions

* All files in the repository should be encoded in `UTF-8`. Exceptions are test resource files that are used to test other encodings.
* All files in the repository should have Unix-style line endings (LF).
Note it is currently unclear if this can be usefully enforced for Eclipse launch configuration files.
* All documentation should be written in English.

== Project naming conventions

* All Maven artifacts should have the groupId `org.aposin.licensescout`.
* Maven artifacts should have an artifactId of either `licensescout-something` (preferred) or `org.aposin.licensescout.something`.
* The base directory name of a project or Maven module should be equal to its artifactId.
Note: seeral tools assueme this convention and, if not followed, will require additional configuration or simply won't work.

== Doing releases

=== Setup for releases

You need a local Maven installation.

You need basic knowledge of Maven. If you are new to Maven, check out this:
https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html


=== Customize settings file

[source,xml]
.Minimal settings.xml file
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>                                   <1>
      <username>[SONATYPE ACCOUNT ID]</username>       <2>
      <password>[SONATYPE ACCOUNT PASSWORD]</password> <3>
    </server>
  </servers>

  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.keyname>[PGP SIGNING KEY ID]</gpg.keyname> <4>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>

</settings>
----
<1> this server ID is related to the definitions under `<distributionManagement>` in the parent POM
and is referenced in the configuration of the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin`
<2> replace the value with the username of your sonatype account
<3> replace the value with the password of your sonatype account
<4> replace the value with the ID of your GPG key that should be used for code signing

=== Use encrypted passwords
It is highly recommended to use encrypted passwords in the `settings.xml` file as described in these resources:

* https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html
* https://blog.sonatype.com/2009/10/maven-tips-and-tricks-encrypting-passwords/

=== Release profile

There is a profile that contains the parts of LicenseScout that should be released (`release-modules`).
It references the following modules:

* `licensescout-parent` (not referenced explicitly, but as the containing POM)
* `licensescout-core`
* `licensescout-maven-utils`
* `licensescout-maven-plugin`
* `licensescout-report-maven-plugin`
* `org.aposin.licensescout.configuration.sample`

=== Doing a snapshot release

A Maven profile `snapshot-release` is used for this.

To do a snapshot release take the following steps:

* Do the following on the command line:

[source, bash]
----
> cd org.aposin.licensescout.release-aggrgator
> mvn -s .../settings-licensescout-minimal.xml -Psnapshot-release clean deploy
----

IMPORTANT: The command will also work without the profile, but sources will not be included and the artifacts will not be signed.

NOTE: No commits to the repository are needed, since the version numbers of the projects remain unchanged.


=== Doing a (main) release manually

A Maven profile `release` is used for this.

To do a release take the following steps:

* Do the following on the command line:

[source, bash]
----
> cd org.aposin.licensescout.release-aggrgator
> mvn -s .../settings-licensescout-minimal.xml -Prelease -Drevision=1.005 clean deploy
----

TODO: this is unfinished

* mvn scm:tag

NOTE: the release version number is composed of the part in the POM ('1.4.') and the property 'revision' provided on the command line (example: '1.005').
This results in the actual version number (example: '1.4.1.005').

== Profiles overview

.Profiles
[cols="1m,2", options="header"]
|===
|Profile ID|Purpose
|snapshot-release|Doing snapshot releases
|release|Doing (main) releases
|github-upload|Upload of binaries to Github
|ci-modules|Modules used in the CI build
|site-modules|Modules used for site generation
|release-modules|Modules used for releases
|it-modules|Modules used in integration testing
|license-header-modules|Modules used in the license header check
|clean-site-staging|Cleans the global site staging directory
|run-its|Run integration tests
|only-eclipse|Contains M2E definitions that lead to errors in normal reactor runs
|===


== Site generation

Site generation is done in two steps:

. Generating content and staging to a local directory using the run configuration `licensescout-parent_multimodule_site_stage`.
This does a `package site site:stage` with the profiles `site-modules,clean-site-staging`. Note that `package` is necessary due to a Maven bug (https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/MDEP-98)

. Checkin from the staging directory to the `gh-pages` branch using he run configuration
`licensescout-parent_site_publish` which does `scm-publish:publish-scm`.

Note the definitions:
[source, xml]
----
</properties>
  ...
  <github.owner>aposin</github.owner>
  <siteStagingDirectory>${java.io.tmpdir}/licensescout-site-stage</siteStagingDirectory>
  <siteBranch>gh-pages</siteBranch>
</properties>
----

You can find out the actual directory staging is done to from th logs:

[source, bash]
----
[INFO] Pushing C:\Users\matthias\git\LicenseScout\licensescout-report-maven-plugin\target\site
[INFO]    >>> to file://C:\Users\matthias\AppData\Local\Temp\licensescout-site-stage/licensescout-report-maven-plugin
----

The generation uses site descriptor inheritance. To make this work, the parent POM does an `attachDescriptor`.

== Maintaining Eclipse run configurations

All run configurations should:

* Use "Execution environment: JavaSE-11" as runtime JDK.
This allows to have a common definition in the configurations checked in into the repository.
Make sure you have "Execution Environment JavaSE-11" actually mapped to a JDK11 installation.
* Be stored in a folder "launch" in the related project.
This convention makes sense to keep the root folder of a module clean.
* Use a Maven runtime named `apache-maven-current`.
Eclipse has to be configured that an external Maven installation with this name exists.
(See Window / Preferences / Maven / Installations)

=== Naming conventions


== Repository structure

The maven projects should be stored in a folder with the name being the `artifactId` of the maven project.
Note that there are several tools, from reporting plugins to deploy plugins that assume this nming convention. If the naming convention is not followed, the tools won't ork as expected or require additional configuration per project.

== Editing XML files

For `pom.xml` and `site.xml` the following applies:

* indentation should be done with one tab
* Depending on your preferences, you may or may not want to use formatting in the Eclipse XML editor, make sure that formatting of comments is turned off (Window / Preferences / XML / XML Files / Editor / Format comments).


== Integration tests

The projects containing Maven Plug-ins (`licensescout-maven-plugin`, `licensescout-report-maven-plugin`) contain integration tests that simulate calling the Plug-ins from a normal Maven runtime environment.

The integration tests are under the directories `src/it`.

For executing the integration tests two profiles are used: `run-its` and `it-modules`.

The integration tests are also executed as checks for pull requests on Github (work in progress, see travis config file).

There is an Eclipse launch configurations to execute the integration tests locally:
`licensescout-parent/launch/licensescout-parent_multimodule_it.launch`

A currently unsolved problem is that the Eclipse launch configuration requires the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` set. A value is included in the launch configuration. However, its value is installation specific and needs to be adapted
for different machines before executing the launch configuration.

For tracking problems with the execution of the ITs have a look at the build logs located at:
 target/its/[it name]/build.log

Note that also the target folder of an IT execution is available:
 target/its/[it name]/target
