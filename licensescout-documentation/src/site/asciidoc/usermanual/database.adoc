== Setting up LicenseScout database

The following files contains an SQL script that creates the tables in the database needed for storing the LicenseScout results.

* `licensescout-core/sql/licensescout-mysql.sql`
* `licensescout-core/sql/licensescout-h2.sql`
* `licensescout-core/sql/licensescout-hsqldb.sql`


== Database driver

The LicenseScout has no implicit dependency on JDBC drivers.
To connect to a database, it is necessary to configure a dependency to
a JDBC driver in the plugin's configuration.
See the link:../../licensescout-maven-plugin/examples/alternative-dbms.html[examples of `licensescout-maven-plugin`] on how to do this.
