== Tweaking the set of artifacts that appear in the license report

Usually, you want only third-party artifacts in your license report, but exclude your own artifacts.
This can be achieved by two means:

1. Vendor names to exclude
2. Global filters

== Documenting manually researched Licenses

Once you have researched Licenses of an artifact manually, it is also
necessary to document the findings in a structured way.
It may be after years that some legal department is asking why you came to the idea that
a certain artifact has a certain license. So it is required to:

* have the documentation structured in a way that it is easily possible to find the information on a certain version of a certain artifact.
* have the information in a permanent storage
* rely on information sources that can be verified after a long time

The original authors of the LicenseScout use a GIT repository to store the information. The repository has a simple structure:
the top-level directories are the names of the artifact as detected by the LicensScout.
the second level directories are the version numbers of the artifact as detected by the LiceseScout
In some cases where the filename contains a version number, but we have sub-directories for different versions anyway, we leave out the version number from the top-level directory.
